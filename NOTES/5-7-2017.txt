Initial thoughts 5/4/17

Software to use
- PhaserJs for GameEngine (can use es6)
- NodeJs WebSockets (IO or existing? Probably should just make a wrapper)
- Webpack for Compilation, use dev Server for Hot Loading
- Use Sequelize for database interface ORM(been super into this one as of late)
- I liked passport for auth and sessions

Game Ideas 5/5/2017

- Multiplayer DoodleJump (traps and powerups?)
- Competitive brick smasher? Bricks drop from top in random assortments
-


Sprints 5-7-17 -> 5-13-17

Going with competitive brick smasher

## I am setting up sprints everyday, to avoid discouragement.

Sunday 5/7/17 -
  - Spin up Node app with server and routes.
      - Auth
        - Passport Js
        - Express Session?(Don't waste time on this)

      - Routes
          - User
              - signup
                  - redirects to activate and sends activation email
              - signing
              - activate
                  - has field for access code
                  - once code is entered redirects to user profile
              - deactivate
              - profile
                  - Username
                  - High Score
                  - User Session Scores? Or top 5? Or Both?

          - Game
              - Root
                  - game
                      - if user is not signed in redirect to Signin/Signup
              - Routes
                  - highscores
                      - Show all highscores

                          - filter by date and score
                  - play

                          - redirects to play/multiplayer and searches for another player

                          - redirects to play/newgame generates channel code to share with a friend
