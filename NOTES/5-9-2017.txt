Whew. Super busy today. Late start BEHIND. NO REST FOR THE WEARY.

Routing --
  -Finish Testing routes.

Views --
  - Broke down. Used ReactJs as front-end framework.
  - Sorry not sorry

Storage --
  - Try some S3? Maybe a later Feature for user Profiles?

GENERAL COMMENTS ---
  - These are getting smaller because setup is wrapping up. Will be scary again when developing the game.
